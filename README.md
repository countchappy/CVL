# CVL 
**Chapster's Valheim Launcher**
 
CVL is a tool for launching Valheim. I built it because I don't trust my friends with backing up their files and because it was difficult for them to connect to my dedicated server. CVL is an attempt to solve those issue.

It currently allows you to do the following:

 1. Store a list of dedicated servers that you can directly launch to
 2. Backup character and world data to prevent loss of progress

That's it ... For now at least.

What I would like to add:

 1. Check if steam is running before launching
 2. Implement backup file restoration in the launcher (right now it's a manual process)
	- Potentially parse the character file so that I can show data during this process *(long term goal ... maybe)*
 3. Other stuff too ... We will see
